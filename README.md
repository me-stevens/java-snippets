This is the site for my Java code snippets.

Check it here: http://javasnippets.tk

**Mental Notes:**

Using:

* Jekyll & GitHub pages
* Permalinks for pages and no posts, menunames, user defined variable, only one default layout
* Alegreya Sans by Huerta tipogr&aacute;fica
* [Prefix-free](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree), by Lea Verou
* [prism](http://prismjs.com), by Lea Verou, for Java and Bash (funky skin)
* Sass compressed
* mathjax, user defined variable. If present, load MathJax

**To do**
 - [ ] Still thinking in a way to not show something if the main page is loaded
 - [ ] Remember that `code` and `pre` require that the opening tag character is written like an HTML entity (for example, `i<N`).
