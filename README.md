#Java Snippets

VERY BASIC snippets of code that I find myself using all the time. Maybe they are useful for you too? Who knows.

Each snippet is inside a folder and has a main program. Sometimes there are other classes too.

It's quite simple, but there is also a site that explains it all: http://javasnippets.tk
